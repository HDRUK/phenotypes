### Implementation 
<pre>Use MODIFIED CALIBER 'Peripheral arterial disease' (PAD) phenotyping algorithm: 

At the specified date, a patient is considered to have 'Peripheral arterial disease' IF they meet any of the criteria below on or before the specified date. 

The earliest date on which the individual meets any of the following criteria on or before the specified date is defined as the first event date:
1.	Primary care
    1.	Peripheral vascular disease diagnosis during a consultation. arterial_gprd: category 7
    2.	Record of history of PVD during a consultation. The following Read codes from CPRD:
        1.	Read:14F7.00	Medcode: 106762	Descr:H/O: arterial lower limb ulcer
        2.	Read:14NB.00	Medcode: 59534	Descr: H/O: Peripheral vascular disease procedure
    3.	Leg or aortic embolism or thrombosis diagnosis during a consultation. arterial_gprd: category 8
    4.	'Peripheral arterial disease' procedures, excluding repair of AAA recording during a consultation. pad_opcs_gprd: category 3
    5.	Abnormal 'Peripheral arterial disease' (PAD) ultrasound or Doppler study results recorded during a consultation. As per implementation of pad_ud_gprd in CALIBER
    6.	Abnormal 'Peripheral arterial disease' angiography results recorded during a consultation. As per implementation of pad_angio_gprd in CALIBER
2.	Secondary care
    1.	Primary or secondary diagnosis of Peripheral vascular disease during a hospitalization. arterial_hes: category 7
    2.	Primary or secondary diagnosis of leg or aortic embolism or thrombosis during a hospitalization. arterial_hes: category 8
    3.	Recording of 'Peripheral arterial disease' procedures, excluding repair of AAA. pad_procs_opcs: category 3</pre>
